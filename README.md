# Global COVID-19 Trends Analysis

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries (if available in the dataset), and vaccinations across different countries and over time. It involves cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends using Python data analysis and visualization tools.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Import and clean global COVID-19 data from a reliable source (Our World in Data).
* Analyze time trends of COVID-19 metrics (cases, deaths, and vaccinations) for selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India) and the world.
* Compare COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.
* Visualize these trends using various charts and maps to aid understanding.
* Communicate the key findings and insights in a clear and concise manner, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## Tools and Libraries Used

The following tools and Python libraries were used in this project:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis, including loading and cleaning the dataset.
* **matplotlib:** A fundamental library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
* **seaborn:** A high-level data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing more aesthetic and informative statistical graphics.
* **Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension):** An interactive development environment for writing and running the code, as well as documenting the analysis.

## How to Run/View the Project

To run or view this project, you will need to:

1.  **Install the required libraries:** If you don't have them already, you can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    If you are using Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have it installed as well:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
2.  **Download the dataset:** Download the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and save it in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook file.
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.
4.  **Run the notebook cells:** Open the project notebook (the `.ipynb` file) and execute the code cells sequentially. The output, including visualizations and printed results, will be displayed within the notebook.
5.  **Alternatively (if using VS Code):** Open the `.ipynb` file in VS Code with the Jupyter extension installed and run the cells.
6.  **View as a static report (optional):** You can export the Jupyter Notebook as a PDF or HTML file to view a static version of the analysis and its results.

## Insights and Reflections

*(This section should be filled in with the specific insights you gained from your analysis. Here are some general examples to get you started, based on the code we've run):*

* The trends in total COVID-19 cases and deaths varied significantly across the selected countries (Kenya, USA, India, and the World), highlighting the different impacts and trajectories of the pandemic in these regions.
* The timing and magnitude of waves of new infections were not uniform, suggesting the influence of local factors, interventions, and the emergence of different variants at different times.
* The cumulative vaccination rates showed different patterns of progress across the countries, potentially reflecting varying access to vaccines, rollout strategies, and public health policies.
* Analyzing the death rate (total deaths divided by total cases) over time provided insights into the severity of the pandemic and how it may have changed as the pandemic evolved.
* *(Add any specific observations about the peak periods, rates of increase/decrease, or comparisons you made between countries.)*

**Reflections:**

* Working with real-world data often involves dealing with missing values and inconsistencies, requiring careful data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Visualizations are powerful tools for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets like this.
* The choice of metrics (e.g., total cases vs. cases per million, cumulative vs. daily changes) can significantly influence the insights derived from the data.
* Further analysis could explore correlations between different metrics (e.g., vaccination rates and case numbers) or investigate the impact of specific events or policies.
